Title of the project: Rock Paper Scissors

Description:
The goal of our website is to display the game Rock Paper Scissors. There will be 3 images on the screen, each for rock, paper and scissors respectively. The player will click on an image to show their choice. Our code will be set so that the computer then makes a randomized choice of one of the images as well. The screen will display who won that round. The code will also keep track of the points for each side using a counter variable on the client-side. After 3 rounds, whoever has more points wins. A screen will pop up showing the message for who won the game at the end of the 3 rounds.
